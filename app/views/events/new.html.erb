        <h4>Lakes of Fire <%= t(:year) %> What Where When!</h4>
        <p>This guide is a volunteer project organized by the Info_bot team. Submit your events below to be included in the printed WhatWhereWhen guide that will be handed out at the gate at Lakes of Fire! They will also be included in any mobile or web-apps about Lakes of Fire events. We reserve the right to make changes for clarity.</p>
        <p>Please use the <a href="/events.xml">XML feed</a> of this event guide for good! Contact Info_bot at info-bot@lakesoffire.org with any questions or software bugs.</p>
        <p>Along with submitting an event, you can edit your event. Just remember to log in with the same account you used to create it. Events will no longer be editable once we send the guide to the printer.</p>
